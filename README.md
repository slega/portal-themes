# Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal themes

The Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal offers robust capabilities for customizing the visual appearance of the portal. This repository presents vanilla themes tailored for each release of the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal.

These themes are neatly organized by release. To obtain a theme for a specific release, simply navigate to the corresponding folder (e.g., [v1.8.0](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/portal-themes/tree/main/v1.8.0) for [the portal's 1.8.0 release](https://tyk.io/docs/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/release-notes/portal-1.8.0/)) and download the theme zip archive. Within the archive, you will find a vanilla theme that is guaranteed to be compatible with the selected release.

For comprehensive guidance on customization, please refer to [the Developer workflow](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/customise-enterprise-portal/full-customisation/developer-workflow/) documentation. It offers an in-depth exploration of the customization process within the Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal, providing valuable insights and step-by-step instructions to tailor the portal according to your specific needs.
